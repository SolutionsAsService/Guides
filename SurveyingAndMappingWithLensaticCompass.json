    "Basic Principles": {
      "CompassBearing": "A bearing is the direction from one point to another, expressed in degrees. The bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.",
      "Declination": "The angle difference between true north (geographic north) and magnetic north. It must be accounted for accurate navigation."
    },
    "StepByStepGuide": {
      "1_Preparation": {
        "a_SetupCompass": {
          "Instructions": "Open the compass and ensure it is level. Check for magnetic interference.",
          "Note": "Keep the compass away from metallic objects and electronic devices."
        },
        "b_IdentifyDeclination": {
          "Instructions": "Determine the local magnetic declination using a map or online resources and adjust your compass readings accordingly."
        }
      },
      "2_TakingBearings": {
        "a_SelectTarget": {
          "Instructions": "Choose a visible landmark or feature to use as your target.",
          "Example": "A tree, building, or hilltop."
        },
        "b_AlignCompass": {
          "Instructions": "Hold the compass level, sight the target through the lens and align the sighting wire with the target."
        },
        "c_ReadBearing": {
          "Instructions": "Rotate the dial until the luminous line aligns with the magnetic needle. Read the bearing at the index line."
        },
        "d_RecordBearing": {
          "Instructions": "Write down the bearing in your notebook, including any adjustments for declination."
        }
      },
      "3_MeasuringDistances": {
        "a_DirectMeasurement": {
          "Instructions": "Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the distance between two points on the ground.",
          "Example": "For short distances or detailed surveys."
        },
        "b_Pacing": {
          "Instructions": "Count your steps to estimate distances over longer stretches. Calibrate your step length beforehand."
        }
      },
      "4_Triangulation": {
        "a_SelectLandmarks": {
          "Instructions": "Choose at least two prominent landmarks visible from your position.",
          "Example": "Hilltops, towers, or distinctive trees."
        },
        "b_TakeBearings": {
          "Instructions": "Take bearings to each landmark and record them."
        },
        "c_PlotBearings": {
          "Instructions": "On your map, draw lines corresponding to the recorded bearings from the landmarks. The intersection point is your location."
        }
      },
      "5_CreatingMaps": {
        "a_DrawBaseMap": {
          "Instructions": "Start with a blank sheet of paper. Draw a north arrow and scale bar."
        },
        "b_AddFeatures": {
          "Instructions": "Plot landmarks, paths, and other features using the bearings and distances recorded. Use symbols and labels for clarity."
        },
